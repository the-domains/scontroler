## COMPLETE CATALOG

The Steam Controller is designed to work with all the games on Steam: past, present, and future. Even the older titles in the catalog and the ones which were not built with controller support. (We've fooled those older games into thinking they're being played with a keyboard and mouse, but we've designed a gamepad that's nothing like either one of those devices.) We think you'll agree that we're onto something with the Steam Controller, and now we want your help with the design process.
